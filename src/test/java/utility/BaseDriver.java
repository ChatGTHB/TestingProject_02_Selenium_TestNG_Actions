//  Java fast - Website slow
//  It tries to find the java element, but the website is still loading, it says I couldn't find java before the site is loaded, and it ends,
//  When trying to find web element (FindElement/s) -->
//  Solution 1: we will give some time (20s)

//  Thread.sleep(); -> It stops Java directly for the given time. The more seconds you give, the more it stops the program. That's why it doesn't work for us.
//  For example, we gave him 20 seconds to exit when he finds us, we want him to find java at 10 seconds and exit, not to wait 20 seconds.
